I ordered a cheese burger with some sauce and got fries, onion rings, and sweet potato waffle fries to share. I ordered the burger medium rare however it came out medium well but it was still pretty juicy. The best side here is their sweet potato waffle fries which are delicious!! Cassell's is a pretty good burger place to try if you're ever in the area. Get their sweet potato fries and different sauces!!\n",

That's right \"Re Dunk You Lus!!!!\" If you get a chance to roam around the hotel next door that's dope too. It's beautiful and I hear they have rooftop morning yoga!  Whoop whoop!!!They got a 4 star from me only because parking was absolutely horrible!!!!

      "5.리뷰내용: Rating: 4 1/2 Stars, Background On Visit: Along the way to Zion Super Market, we walked by this place and saw so many people. The name of the diner sounded so familiar. I quickly looked at the yelp app and realized that I had bookmarked it!Credit Cards: They are accepted.Location/Parking: Located on the first floor of Hotel Normandie. Meter parking can found on any of the neighboring streets. Just be cautious of the time restraints. If you come after 6, free parking everywhere.Ambiance/Decor: If you are familiar with the game, Diner Dash, the ambiance is exactly like this when we were there.Service: Service was fine even though it took while to flag someone down. The staffers were zipping by really fast. Food came out a bit slow, but the item we ate was worth wait. Hamburger Of Choice: We ended up sharing a cheeseburger. We decided on swiss cheese (FYI: Rank 7th on the healthiest cheese. Yahooooo). Omg, it was so yummmmmm! It felt like eating a healthy burger. Yes, it's true. Let me explain to y'all. It burger wasn't greasy and didn't feel heavy after finishing! The 1/3 lb. patty was very juicy, moist, and flavorful. It wasn't salty and didn't need any condiments (ranch, ketchup, and etc) to eat with it. The Portuguese bun was great! Never had it before, but it resembled a little bit like brioche bread. Wished every burger joint incorporated them in their burgers! Drink Of Choice: Definitely go with the lemonade. Very refreshing and very yum!Burger Joint For Thought: Definitely coming back!\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: This review is based on food, not based on the terrible customer service who forgot my sauces and then managed to spill my trash/plate all over my clothes and didn't even apologize.......So the food was SO GOOD. Hands down did NOT expect the food to be so good!!! I think i ordered an off the menu item which was like a Tennessee patty melt???????????? and the DCF chicken sandwich. My boyfriend and I split it/ cut them in half. Both were equally delicious! Had to take turns taking bites of each because they were so good. The chicken was fantastic! The meat in the melt was also super good! Not chewy or anything . Before I started my meal, i asked the waiter for some dipping sauces... he kept looking at me from the counter and I would look back ... but he still never brought it. When the waiter was cleaning the table, he picked up the plates and then somehow tipped it and got trash/leftover food all over my clothes. Thankfully I wasn't wearing anything too fancy but that's still rude! Didn't get much of an apology.... but thanks lol Hands down great food though!!\n",

Screw you intermittent fasting - hellooooo Cassell's. P.S - no parking available but don't let this stop you - have patience and a light will shine on your destined parking spot Let's start with the friendly faces - the servers were all wonderful. So thank you, I greatly appreciate it. Food - I can't - it's just too darn good to even describe how it tastes like. My chili cheese fries were an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I even ate the tomato bits and I really hate tomatoes. The milkshakes are a bit pricey ($7) but so amazing. Props to my server Raul who went out of his way to add extra ice to my milkshake - I knew and he knew it was an odd request but he took it like a champ and fed me all of the ice I wanted. My bill totaled $30 for 2. 1 burger, chili cheese fries and milkshake. Worth every penny.\n"

I didn't think the texture of the hash brown would be this good so it definitely exceeded expectations. The burger was cooked well done and the seasonings made it so delicious. They add plenty of avocado on the burger and it was fresh! Everything about this dish was amazing and I would get it again, for sure! I also tried their pie this time. I got the dulce de leche banana (banana and caramel) and OH MY DAMN you have to get this! Best pie ever, no lie. I'm not really a pie person but yelp hyped it up and it definitely lived up to the hype.Always a good experience at Cassell's! Shannon was our waiter this time and she was super nice! Very attentive and quick. Always made sure we had everything we needed. Can't wait to come back!\n",

I was thinking breakfast burger but ordered the breakfast burrito. No doubt it was good but after tasting the cheese burger I was sold. I know I didn't want cheese at that moment but I don't know what happened. The place is open with seating at tables or at the bar if your alone. They have crafted beer if you'd like and also different pies you can choose from. I wanted an apple pie but I didn't see it in the glass. Place get busy so arrive early and place your order. Sitting next to the window is best option if your carrying a purse as you can put it on the window sill.\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: Was expecting a lot more out of a burger that costs $12+ and that David Chang has rated so highly...I would say the best part about this burger is the bread. The rye bread was some of the best I've ever had and came beautifully griddled. A+The cheese was also very good. I like how they melted part of it straight on the griddle to get extra crispiness for textural contrast.As for the 1/3 pound burger patty itself? Meh. It wasn't memorable in any way; to be honest I think that Shake Shack does a far better burger blend in terms of creating a unique and flavorful taste profile.We ran into George Motz eating here on our way out, so maybe I'm missing something between him and Dave Chang, but I won't be back here anytime soon.\n",

The burger patties were cooked to perfection, the French fries were salty and delicious, and the sweet potato waffle fries were to die for (they also had a hint of sweetness which was on point). Oh and the milkshake was the best milkshake I've ever had!The one downside is the it get VERY loud in the restaurant, not just the amount of people but the music is on a little too loud in my opinion.

We came here stunned 10:30 on a random Tuesday. Not crowded at all. We ordered the regular cheeseburger with 1000 island dressing. All the veggies and sauces come on the side. When they delivered the burger, the first thing I noticed was the amazing aroma filling up my nostrils. The quality of the meat and the perfect char came through on that first bite. The crispness of the hand formed patty and the freshness of the pickles, tomatoes and lettuce danced in my mouth. Cassell's!! Who knew!! I grew up in this neighborhood all my life and didn't even know this place existed!!! Now that I know, I'll be back!\n",

On date night, we both order two cheeseburgers cooked medium rare, shared sweet potatoes fries, and a \"special\" cookies n cream milkshake. Burger came on a tray with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and the homemade ketchup that we could dress up our burgers to our liking. Great concept.

I don't usually like pies so you can trust me when I say it's BOMB! The light and fluffy whip cream swirled on a layer of bananas and dulce de lece perfectly laid on top of a buttery graham cracker crust. Need I say more??I also got the cheeseburger and my friends got the breakfast burger which was a patty with avocado and egg sandwiched in a hashbrown bun. The meat was well seasoned but I honestly was expecting more. The burger seemed too simple for all the raving reviews as well as the price. It was $11.75 for just the burger. It was still good but think it's too pricey for what it is. The truffle fries on the other hand were amazing. Shaved parmesan, and truffle oil. Enough said. I will come back to try the patty melt next time! Will be back for the pie and patty melt next time! Love the cozy, old diner ambiance. Perfect for a date night or a hangout with friends!Also, no valet, only street parking!\n",

Everything but the burger and cheese are served on the side, so you can stack it as you please. It came out medium-well even though I ordered it medium, which meant that it wasn't as juicy.  I also had a strawberry shake was with malt.

You can customize your burger with toppings for additional cost and they also have a vegan burger option. The beef patty also isn't super thick and makes the burgers easy to eat. The house made cherry cola is my favorite! They have a house made cherry syrup that they make it with. There is a full bar and there are a lot of house made ingredients used to make a variety of drinks here. I've yet to try a lot of them but watching the bartender work allowed me to see the quality of ingredients and craft they put into drinks - whether it's housemade sodas, mules, mixed drinks, etc. Price point isn't bad either. Only a scooter ride away from my apartment. I'll definitely be coming back\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: YUM!!!! I have seen videos of this restaurant on those popular facebook/buzzfeed type vids and I had to come and try it out. Came in on a weekday afternoon and it was quite crowded but no wait! We ordered the Patty Melt and OMG SO GOOD! The slices of cheese they use are bigger than the bread itself, so it cooks on the griddle and you are left with a bomb patty melt with some crispy cheese hangover on the side *drools* the beef was also cooked to perfection, medium rare just like I asked. Fries were pretty good, they have a good sauce selection as well. Ask for the crack sauce!!! Prices were a little steep, sandwhiches/burgers themselves ran for $10+ and then sides and fries were $4+ each. Would come back!\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: Always an spectacular experience. This time around  got a double cheeseburger with bacon and grilled onions, medium with cheddar cheese. Slightly overcooked meat but it was still a great burger. We share fries because all of our burgers were giant. And my friends really enjoyed the banana pie. I didn't have any this time because I was too full but it's amazing pie. Parking sucks because it's right on a major street in KTown. You might have to pay for parking at a near lot or get lucky finding street parking. It is still worth it for a premium burger. This isn't In n Out, $7-8 meal so be mindful of that. Definitely in my top five burger places in Los Angeles. Simple menu with delicious and fresh ingredients. Give it a try for some amazing burgers and pie too\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: Anyone who reads my reviews knows I have a price/expectation ratio. The more you charge for something, the higher my expectations are.Sadly, for a place that I keep finding on the \"best burger in L.A.\" lists, this place fell somewhat short. They were busy on a weeknight evening. They were filming T Pains School of Business (or something) while I was there. It was on the other side of the restaurant though so didn't bother me much. The servers were great although a little harried. I ordered a patty melt because c'mon, its a patty melt. No other way can you show off your burger cooking chops than making a killer patty melt. I waited. And waited. And waited. I was getting a little impatient by the time my patty melt came out. For close to $13 i was expecting a little more. The bread was spot on, I love a good rye, toasted but not too much. The cheese was melted perfectly. Then things started going off the rails. The grilled onions were sparse (and that's being generous). Half were grilled and half were burnt. I mean burnt to the point of leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Like eating something that fell onto the charcoal. And the patty itself. It was cooked properly (Yay!) but bland to the point of forgetfulness. It just didn't have that beefy, burgery taste that makes a burger great. You get a patty melt to enjoy the patty. This patty left me feeling like hmmmm.Then the fries. For another almost $4 ($3.75 to be fair). They were pretty decent fries but not for $4. Not when I just dropped $13 on an average, at best, patty melt. They have pie. I didn't have any. I wasn't in the mood to wait around and was feeling underwhelmed by my food anyway. I love the idea. I love that they took an old place that went under and revived it. Now I just wish I had loved the patty melt. 'Oh well.\n",

Oh also get the garlic mustard and spicy mayo these are also musts! ;)Apart from the prices the other reason as to why Im dropping a star would be parking.

      "5.리뷰내용: Once, I came here and was enjoying my food. A whole party of about 6 came in and sat down before ordering. After waiting a bit one of the employees informed them that they were supposed to order before sitting down (as it says on the signs on the tables) which, in this case, meant their spot might be taken. One man threw an absolute fit, yelling and cussing and saying he wasn't even going to eat there. He stormed out while his embarrassed friends remained. They all decided to eat there, while he went somewhere else to eat, apparently. The group who stayed DEFINITELY made the right choice. I've been here many times with my boyfriend, and with my parents. Usually what happens is one person orders a tuna melt and another orders the burger and we split it. That way, everyone gets the best of both worlds. I'm a huge tuna melt fan - I go around to different restaurants to find the best one. And this is HANDS-DOWN the best I've tasted so far. It isn't classic like a diner tuna melt, but it's truly amazing and flavorful. I love the bread they use, too. The burger is also amazing, probably one of my favorite burgers. The fries, as well, are great. If you haven't been here, you should definitely give it a shot. Just make sure to order before seating yourself, haha.\n"

      "5.리뷰내용: Mixed thoughts about Golden State. I'm trying to limit my intake of burgers and decided to try this place on a whim. Located across from Canter's, you'll understand this area has crap parking (metered street but it's always taken) or if you're lucky, some neighborhood streets are okay. The latter is what I ended up with near Canter's so a quick walk across Fairfax wasn't an issue. Right when I opened the door, I encountered a line, which gave me time to check out the place. Small side, wooden seats, pretty much filled to capacity so I take this as a good sign. There was a slight wait due to the line but a nice guy handed out menus to us who needed them. I ordered 'The Burger' (+avocado for $2) with fries as the side, and waited about 10 minutes or so for it. Guy who handed me the order was super nice and thanked me for waiting. 'Fry' sauce was okay, I was good with just regular ketchup. Burger was fine, a little messy but that doesn't hinder the taste. Not much avocado as I have had with other places but glad it was still there. As for that, it was alright, can't complain. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. Certainly had worse, also had better. As you can tell, I'm completely on the fence about Golden State, but if you're craving a burger and you are in the Fairfax area, I recommend you give it a try.\n",

Their IPA on tap was A1. Service is also on point! Will definitely come back more often!!\n",

You order at the counter then find a seat. We ordered \"the burger\" and the BLTA. Each meal comes with a side and we got the fries and the cucumber salad. The BLTA was pretty large with a generous amount of bacon. It comes on a ciabatta type bun. The burger was sooo delicious. It comes on a brioche bun and I ordered it medium rare. It was cooked perfectly and the flavors all go together really well. The cucumber salad was nice and light and complimented the sandwich and burger. Fries tasted good as well and came in a large portion. They have a curry sauce along with ketchup. Definitely recommend the curry sauce, it was really delicious!! Parking can be difficult to find since it's right on Fairfax. We found free street parking near Fairfax High School, although beware of the street signs.\n",

The lamb burger sounded to good to pass up so we didn't. It was great and very very big. It came with sweet potato fries which were a little soggy but good as was the sauce it came with. Highly recommended and looking for to going back.Here for the second time. Took it to go like before. Although delicious we asked for our lamb burgers to be more well done then they were. Other than that the fries were plentiful and the jalapeño slaw was ok but not amazing.\n",

I found street meter parking on a weekday evening but note that parking might be congested during popular weekend hours. I found the service to be very prompt and helpful! You order at the counter and they'll give you a number to pick any table to serve you.The Burger ($15) and the Lamb Burger ($15) were both cooked to perfection and very flavorful. Depending on which one you pick based on your protein preference, I think you'll be pleasantly satiated. Each burger comes with a side. Both the fries and sweet potato wedges were delicious. Really glad they automatically included with burger purchase. Golden State is definitely on rotation for a future burger craving.\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: The Golden State, with legions of loyal fans and quite possibly the most hyped burger in Los Angeles and perhaps just as famous for their beer floats, is worthy of all its praises in my book.The Burger, $15 - Harris Ranch beef, Fiscalini Farm's cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, arugula, aioli and ketchup. Well seasoned, melted cheddar cheese and just the right amount of sauces and other toppings including a perfect sized strip of bacon. Nearly flawless in preparation. I like my meat a little juicer (ordered it medium well). It was, nonetheless, one of the tastiest burgers I have ever had.Fries, $5. I have never been much of a fan of the twice fried, super crunchy fries. Probably would opt for a different side dish next time.Other burger options include lamb, turkey and vegan. All come with your choice of sides, which includes: fries, jalapeno cabbage slaw, cucumber salad, fried sweet potato wedges.The entire menu also includes sandwiches, salads, ice cream scoops, floats, beers, wines, sodas and specialty drinks.Easily one of the best eats in the Mid-Wilshire area and a burger that measures up to any I have tried in LA.Order ahead on-line: thegoldenstatecafe.com\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: Such amazing soft burgers !! That probably sounds weird but the meat was so nice and the buns were so soft that the sandwiches literally almost fell apart.I was wearing parts of the added avocado from The Burger ($15). Which my friend had, and my tuna melt ($12 + $2 make it a melt) sandwich was so yummy! But it was sooo messy (or maybe that's just me haha) and it fell apart as well -- is why I gave it 4 stars. My friend thought The Burger was just delicious but a bit sloppy when eaten as well. Keep those toothpicks in!! The sweet potato fries are so hearty and filling so beware. The way to go with them are WELL DONE for sure, it was suggested by one of their employees and I'd def take it into consideration. Also, they have a bunch of craft beers, all of the varieties are written up on black board panels on the wall. You order first then, go sit down with your number... don't forget your number lol! Super casual place too so sweats and a hoodie was totally my jam when I was here. Gotta try The Burger here it is soooo good!!! I'd rate it over some of the other local burger spots in this area for sure. Nom nom and enjoy!\n"

      "5.리뷰내용: So we came here after experiencing 60Out escape room on Melrose at around 1 pm on a Saturday. When we walked in, the place was small (maybe seven seating area's) but wasn't too crowded, which was great because we had a party of eight! We quickly found a spot, and as we waited in line to order our food the people started pouring in.Food: Most of us got The Burger ($13) which has applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, aioli sauce, and ketchup in it. I got mine medium rare with a side of fried sweet potato wedges. They server beers and soda from a glass bottle, but most of us got their water cup :)The burgers came out very fast! We were really surprised! And they were really good! They have two kinds of ketchup - curry and regular. I really enjoyed the curry kind on my burger. The curry just gave it more depth in flavor. The meat wasn't greasy, and the buns were brioche, I think. Very good combo, and, although a burger isn't the healthiest option, it wasn't very heavy. I think this is also because you didn't get a whole lot of wedges, either. Everything was proportioned just right, and almost everyone left feeling satisfied, not gut-busting full.Parking: Tricky! You can park on the street, but I would rather park in the surrounding neighborhood for free. Also, there's lots of traffic around that area, so going a mile might take 10 minutes.\n",

While they enjoyed their meal, they expressed regret over not trying the burger. In addition, while I don't tend to eat too many fries in a meal, these fries were so well seasoned that I couldn't resist eating almost all of them. I surprised even myself with that. Now this wasn't the best burger my mouth has ever bitten into, but it definitely hit the spot. I demolished it like a wrecking ball into a building. Rapidly and with gusto. I can see why this burger gets great reviews. I would recommend people to come try the burger at least once. It unfortunately is a bit tight with seating; especially if it is during a meal time, but parking is not that bad around the restaurant. Also get the regular fries, not the sweet potato ones.\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: Wow! Loved this place. Have heard about it for a while but never had a chance to get there. Really glad we finally made it. The guy at the counter was really nice and friendly. Ordered \"The Burger\" with crispy fries and my wife got the turkey burger with the slaw and it came out fast and hot and very tasty. My burger was cooked right, something that doesn't always happen. More importantly, the fries were actually crispy! How often do you order them well-done and they come out regular (are you listening In-N-Out)? The slaw wasn't overly dressed, though could have been a bit spicier. The ambience was great, the service was right on and the food was spectacular. Great job Golden State!\n",

Every single thing was absolutely delicious!! The burger was perfectly cooked, and the toppings and sauce went with the flavor of the meat perfectly. I love crispy fries and these did not disappoint. The minted lemonade was beyond refreshing and I even bought another one - it was that good! Would definitely recommend this place for a good bite to eat in the area.\n",

      "5.리뷰내용: We were pretty hungry upon getting into town, so when we walked by this spot, we were sold. Casual burger spots are everywhere, but I felt like this one truly delivered. You enter and order at the counter, then find a place to sit. They give you a number and bring out your food once it's ready. The guy who took our order and checked on us during our meal was friendly and super helpful. I liked the atmosphere, high ceilings, nice vibe, and very clean. Bathrooms were also clean. They had bottled coke, sprite and Fanta, as well as beer and wine I believe. We stuck with water. Onto the food. The Burger: I chose the burger which came with cheese, bacon, arugula, ketchup and aioli. It was tasty. I really enjoyed the bun as well. It was definitely a step above what a lot of other burger joints put out. It also came with a choice of side, which leads to...Sweet Potato Wedges: served with garlic aioli these were amazing. I could have eaten an entire plate of these. The aioli paired with the flavor so well. I'm so glad I got them as my side. Grilled Cheese: a basic grilled cheese,but a tasty one nonetheless. They don't skimp on cheese. Regular fries: they were decent. Nothing special but they were good. Overall a nice spot to grab a bite. The burgers are around $15 each but hey, comes with a side. It's expected in the area. I'd return!\n",

The presentation of the food looked so livy and SO good! The burger was nothing but pure deliciousness! The juicy burger had crispy bacon, glazed buns, and an add on of avocado. I don't remember what was entirely on the burger, but I know I ate of the burger and fries pretty quickly and it was pure goodness!! This thousand island lookin sauce was also pretty good!  Would definitely come back and try another food item!\n"
